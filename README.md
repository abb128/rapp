This is a test project I created to learn more about React Native. It was meant to be a text messaging app with a similar design to Discord.

It does not integrate with any back-end, so all of the data is fake.

## Development
This project uses Expo Go to make development simpler.

Download the [Expo Go application](https://expo.dev/expo-go) on your mobile device.

Then, run the following commands:
```
$ npm install
$ npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code in the app and it should run the app.
